# Introduction

Akiyama.IPC is a .NET-based C# library designed for making Inter-process Communication (IPC) quickly and easily accessible.

Akiyama.IPC implements a packet-based communication method, designed to make it easier to handle on both the sending, and receiving ends.

This library supports both .NETFramework (4.7.2+), and .NET 6.0+. Unless otherwise specified, the instructions in this documentation applies to both versions.
